# Platformer
[Platformer](#download-link), action and arcade game.


## About Platformer
It's a small game, the first game that I fully ended, it's not the best, but I am learning, that's the main goal.


## Sword weapon
Watch this video to see an example of platformer gameplay with the keyboard as a sword. The PS4 controller is the natively tested gamepad, but it should work with others as well.

## Laser weapon
I also included a laser in this game. While it is not as effective on a keyboard, this weapon is best suited for a gamepad.

[Presentation video is in progress.]


## Mechanics
There are several game mechanics, it's not needed to know, but you can have some questions that this should answer:

 - Chest heals you, but if you have full health, it gives you power.
 
 - The damage you deal to an enemy when you collide is equal to your damage stat plus 100. If he is still alive, you get damaged.
 
 - Dash is working only with a sword.
 
 - Game supports gamepads.
 
 - Sword slows bullets and, next hit, destroys them.
 
 - The yellow bar under the enemy health bar is attack cooldown, it's not 100% accurate because some attacks shoot more bullets.


## Multiplayer
Multiplayer is hard for me. I want to do it, it fits perfectly to have it in this game, but I don't know what's going on in online games.

If I ever update this game, it'll be a multiplayer update.
